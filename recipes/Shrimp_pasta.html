    <h2>Description :</h2>
      <p>Pasta can be a surprisingly quick meal, and <em>lemon shrimp pasta</em> is a perfect example. It involves just three easy steps: cooking the pasta, preparing the sauce, and combining everything.</p>

      <p>While the pasta cooks, quickly sear the shrimp and set it aside. For the sauce, sauté shallots and garlic, then add lemon zest, lemon juice, chicken broth, and heavy cream for a rich, zesty flavor. Return the shrimp to the pan and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.</p> 

      <p>Finally, toss the spaghetti with fresh basil, red pepper flakes, and the sauce, adding reserved pasta water as needed to achieve the perfect consistency. Enjoy your delicious creation!</p>
