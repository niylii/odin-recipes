This repository represents my first attempt at creating a webpage using only HTML, without any styling. It features a variety of food recipes, showcasing my progress in web development.

Creating a webpage with only HTML involves setting up a basic structure with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. You can add various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables to present content. While the page will be functional,but still lacks styling and layout control typically provided by CSS.
